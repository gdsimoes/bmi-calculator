## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
-   [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Testing framework

### What I learned

This project was my first on Frontend Mentor using Next.js and Vitest, marking a return to building projects from scratch with these technologies. It was a rich learning experience, allowing me to refresh my skills and tackle new challenges. I practiced using server components and created a VisuallyHidden component, heavily inspired by this [Josh Comeau's article](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-components/visually-hidden/). I also faced some CSS challenges:

-   I discovered the [`row-gap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/row-gap) property, which greatly simplified the CSS.

-   I learned techniques for hiding the input elementâ€™s spin button, with [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3790935/can-i-hide-the-html5-number-input-s-spin-box) providing valuable insights.

-   I applied several CSS tricks to style the radio buttons just right, guided by [this article by Stephanie Eckles](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/), which helped me refine my approach.

This experience deepened my understanding of both Next.js and CSS, reinforcing my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

### Continued development

In my upcoming projects, I plan to further enhance my skills in accessibility and testing with Vitest. I also aim to take on more complex full stack projects to deepen my expertise in both front-end and back-end development.
